## Overview
OpenLANE is an opensource tool or flow used for opensource tape-outs. The OpenLANE flow comprises a variety of tools such as Yosys, ABC, OpenSTA, Fault, OpenROAD app, Netgen and Magic which are used to harden chips and macros, i.e. generate final GDSII from the design RTL. The primary goal of OpenLANE is to produce clean GDSII with no human intervention. OpenLANE has been tuned to function for the Google-Skywater130 Opensource Process Design Kit.

## Inception of Opensource EDA

### SoC Design & OpenLANE

#### Components of opensource digital ASIC design
The design of digital Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) requires three enablers or elements - Resistor Transistor Logic Intellectual Property (RTL IPs), Electronic Design Automation (EDA) Tools and Process Design Kit (PDK) data.

![ASIC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86701156/124005001-35a32a80-d9f6-11eb-8fcc-0917ad337699.PNG)

- Opensource RTL Designs: github, librecores, opencores
- Opensource EDA tools: QFlow, OpenROAD, OpenLANE
- Opensource PDK data: Google Skywater130 PDK

The ASIC flow objective is to convert RTL design to GDSII format used for final layout. The flow is essentially a software also known as automated PnR (Place & route).

#### Simplified RTL2GDS Flow

![RTL2GDS flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86701156/124006238-a139c780-d9f7-11eb-8da9-6069b055fbe0.PNG)

![RTLtoGDSIIflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83152452/131134578-5cd34ec9-a388-476b-aa4b-914c250d7ec9.png)

- Synthesis: RTL Converted to gate level netlist using standard cell libraries (SCL)
- Floor & Power Planning: Planning of silicon area to ensure robust power distribution
- Placement: Placing cells on floorplan rows aligned with sites
  - Global Placement: for optimal position of cells
  - Detailed Placement: for legal positions
- Routing: Valid patterns for wires
- Signoff: Physical (DRC, LVS) and Timing verifications (STA)

#### OpenLANE ASIC Flow



![OpenLaneflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83152452/131135115-46148ff1-9489-48f6-a334-6702c25def59.png)

From conception to product, the ASIC design flow is an iterative process that is not static for every design. The details of the flow may change depending on ECO’s, IP requirements, DFT insertion, and SDC constraints, however the base concepts still remain. The flow can be broken down into 11 steps:

1. Architectural Design – A system engineer will provide the VLSI engineer with specifications for the system that are determined through physical constraints. 
   The VLSI engineer will be required to design a circuit that meets these constraints at a microarchitecture modeling level.

2. RTL Design/Behavioral Modeling – RTL design and behavioral modeling are performed with a hardware description language (HDL). 
   EDA tools will use the HDL to perform mapping of higher-level components to the transistor level needed for physical implementation. 
   HDL modeling is normally performed using either Verilog or VHDL. One of two design methods may be employed while creating the HDL of a microarchitecture:
   
    a. RTL Design – Stands for Register Transfer Level. It provides an abstraction of the digital   circuit using:
   
   - i. 	 Combinational logic
   - ii. 	 Registers
   - iii.  Modules (IP’s or Soft Macros)
 
    b. 	Behavioral Modeling – Allows the microarchitecture modeling to be performed with behavior-based modeling in HDL. This method bridges the gap between C and HDL allowing HDL design to be performed

3. RTL Verification - Behavioral verification of design

4. DFT Insertion - Design-for-Test Circuit Insertion

5. Logic Synthesis – Logic synthesis uses the RTL netlist to perform HDL technology mapping. The synthesis process is normally performed in two major steps:

     - GTECH Mapping – Consists of mapping the HDL netlist to generic gates what are used to perform logical optimization based on AIGERs and other topologies created 
       from the generic mapped netlist.
       
     - Technology Mapping – Consists of mapping the post-optimized GTECH netlist to standard cells described in the PDK
  
6. Standard Cells – Standard cells are fixed height and a multiple of unit size width. This width is an integer multiple of the SITE size or the PR boundary. Each standard cell comes with SPICE, HDL, liberty, layout (detailed and abstract) files used by different tools at different stages in the RTL2GDS flow.

7. Post-Synthesis STA Analysis: Performs setup analysis on different path groups.

8. Floorplanning – Goal is to plan the silicon area and create a robust power distribution network (PDN) to power each of the individual components of the synthesized netlist. In addition, macro placement and blockages must be defined before placement occurs to ensure a legalized GDS file. In power planning we create the ring which is connected to the pads which brings power around the edges of the chip. We also include power straps to bring power to the middle of the chip using higher metal layers which reduces IR drop and electro-migration problem.

9. Placement – Place the standard cells on the floorplane rows, aligned with sites defined in the technology lef file. Placement is done in two steps: Global and Detailed. In Global placement tries to find optimal position for all cells but they may be overlapping and not aligned to rows, detailed placement takes the global placement and legalizes all of the placements trying to adhere to what the global placement wants.

10. CTS – Clock tree synteshsis is used to create the clock distribution network that is used to deliver the clock to all sequential elements. The main goal is to create a network with minimal skew across the chip. H-trees are a common network topology that is used to achieve this goal.

11. Routing – Implements the interconnect system between standard cells using the remaining available metal layers after CTS and PDN generation. The routing is performed on routing grids to ensure minimal DRC errors.

The Skywater 130nm PDK uses 6 metal layers to perform CTS, PDN generation, and interconnect routing.

- open_pdks: contains scripts to setup pdks for opensource tools 
- sky130A: contains sky130 pdk files

#### Invoking OpenLANE and Design Preparation 

Openlane can be invoked using docker command followed by opening an interactive session.
flow.tcl is a script that specifies details for openLANE flow.

```
docker
./flow.tcl -interactive
package require openlane 0.9
```

```
prep -design picorv32a
```

![invoke_openlane](./Day_1/images/invoke_openlane.png)


#### Review of files & Synthesis step
* A "runs" folder is generated within the picorv32a folder.
* The merged file is created during the merging operation in the pircorv32a design preparation (it merges lef and techlef files)
* Next, we run the synthesis of picorv32a design in the openlane interactive terminal:

`run_synthesis`

![openlane - placement - run_synthesis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83152452/185788656-fd086122-f98e-4fc0-bd4e-a711555c8435.png)


* The yosys and ABC tools are utilised to convert RTL to gate level netlist.
* Calcuation of Flop Ratio:
```
Flop ratio = Number of D Flip flops 
             ______________________
             Total Number of cells
```

```
dfxtp_4 = 1596,
Number of cells = 10104,
Flop ratio = 1596/10104 = 0.1579 = 15.79%
```
* We may check the success of the synthesis step by checking the synthesis folder for the synthesized netlist file (.v file)
* The synthesis statistics report can be accessed within the reports directory. It is usually the last yosys file since files are listed chronologically by date of modification.
* The synthesis area report are as follows:

## Floorplanning & Placement and library cells

### Floorplanning considerations

#### Utilization Factor & Aspect Ratio  

Two parameters are of importance when it comes to floorplanning namely, Utilisation Factor and Aspect Ratio. They are defined as follows:

```
Utilisation Factor =  Area occupied by netlist
                     __________________________
                        Total area of core
```

```
Aspect Ratio =  Height
               ________
                Width
```
                                  
A Utilisation Factor of 1 signifies 100% utilisation leaving no space for extra cells such as buffer. However, practically, the Utilisation Factor is 0.5-0.6. Likewise, an Aspect ratio of 1 implies that the chip is square shaped. Any value other than 1 implies rectanglular chip.

#### Pre-placed cells

Once the Utilisation Factor and Aspect Ratio has been decided, the locations of pre-placed cells need to be defined. Pre-placed cells are IPs comprising large combinational logic which once placed maintain a fixed position. Since they are placed before placement and routing, the are known as pre-placed cells.

#### Decoupling capacitors

Pre-placed cells must then be surrounded with decoupling capacitors (decaps). The resistances and capacitances associated with long wire lengths can cause the power supply voltage to drop significantly before reaching the logic circuits. This can lead to the signal value entering into the undefined region, outside the noise margin range. Decaps are huge capacitors charged to power supply voltage and placed close the logic circuit. Their role is to decouple the circuit from power supply by supplying the necessary amount of current to the circuit. They pervent crosstalk and enable local communication.

#### Power Planning

Each block on the chip, however, cannot have its own decap unlike the pre-placed macros. Therefore, a good power planning ensures that each block has its own VDD and VSS pads connected to the horizontal and vertical power and GND lines which form a power mesh.

#### Pin Placement

The netlist defines connectivity between logic gates. The place between the core and die is utilised for placing pins. The connectivity information coded in either VHDL or Verilog is used to determine the position of I/O pads of various pins. Then, logical placement blocking of pre-placed macros is performed so as to differentiate that area from that of the pin area.

### CELL DESIGN AND CHARACETRIZATION FLOWS

Library is a place where we get information about every cell. It has differents cells with different size, functionality,threshold voltages. There is a typical cell design flow steps.
1. Inputs : PDKS(process design kit) : DRC & LVS, SPICE Models, library & user-defined specs.
2. Design Steps :Circuit design, Layout design (Art of layout Euler's path and stick diagram), Extraction of parasitics, Characterization (timing, noise, power).
3. Outputs: CDL (circuit description language), LEF, GDSII, extracted SPICE netlist (.cir), timing, noise and power .lib files

### Standard Cell Characterization Flow

A typical standard cell characterization flow that is followed in the industry includes the following steps:

1. Read in the models and tech files
2. Read extracted spice Netlist
3. Recognise behavior of the cells
4. Read the subcircuits
5. Attach power sources
6. Apply stimulus to characterization setup
7. Provide neccesary output capacitance loads
8. Provide neccesary simulation commands

Now all these 8 steps are fed in together as a configuration file to a characterization software called GUNA. This software generates timing, noise, power models.
These .libs are classified as Timing characterization, power characterization and noise characterization.


### TIMING CHARACTERIZATION

In standard cell characterisation, One of the classification of libs is timing characterisation.

#### Timing threshold definitions 
Timing defintion |	Value
-------------- | --------------
slew_low_rise_thr	| 20% value
slew_high_rise_thr | 80% value
slew_low_fall_thr |	20% value
slew_high_fall_thr |	80% value
in_rise_thr	| 50% value
in_fall_thr |	50% value
out_rise_thr |	50% value
out_fall_thr | 50% value

#### Propagation Delay and Transition Time 

**Propagation Delay** 
The time difference between when the transitional input reaches 50% of its final value and when the output reaches 50% of its final value. Poor choice of threshold values lead to negative delay values. Even thought you have taken good threshold values, sometimes depending upon how good or bad the slew, the dealy might be still +ve or -ve.

```
Propagation delay = time(out_thr) - time(in_thr)
```
**Transition Time**

The time it takes the signal to move between states is the transition time , where the time is measured between 10% and 90% or 20% to 80% of the signal levels.

```
Rise transition time = time(slew_high_rise_thr) - time (slew_low_rise_thr)

Low transition time = time(slew_high_fall_thr) - time (slew_low_fall_thr)
```
